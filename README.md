# SpaceX Data Science Project

This repository focuses on analyzing SpaceX launch data, leveraging data science techniques to derive insights, create visualizations, and build predictive models. The project combines exploratory data analysis, machine learning, geospatial analysis, and interactive dashboards.

## Repository Overview

### Key Files and Their Purpose

1. **[spacex_dash_app.py](https://github.com/Sravya1006/DataScience-Project/blob/main/3%20-%20spacex_dash_app.py)**  
   An interactive Dash application for visualizing SpaceX launch success metrics. Users can explore payloads, orbits, and outcomes interactively.  

2. **[lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb](https://github.com/Sravya1006/DataScience-Project/blob/main/lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb)**  
   Geospatial analysis of SpaceX launch sites using Folium. Demonstrates proximity to infrastructure like highways, railways, and coastlines. Integrates calculated distances to explore optimal site locations.

3. **[jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb](https://github.com/Sravya1006/DataScience-Project/blob/main/1%20-%20jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb)**  
   Fetches SpaceX launch data via APIs and processes it for further analysis.  

4. **[edadataviz.ipynb](https://github.com/Sravya1006/DataScience-Project/blob/main/2%20-%20edadataviz.ipynb)**  
   Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) with data visualization libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib.

5. **[SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction_Part_5.ipynb](https://github.com/Sravya1006/DataScience-Project/blob/main/SpaceX_Machine%20Learning%20Prediction_Part_5.ipynb)**  
   Uses machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, SVM) to predict launch outcomes.

6. **[jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb](https://github.com/Sravya1006/DataScience-Project/blob/main/jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb)**  
   Demonstrates SQL-based analysis of SpaceX data in SQLite.

## How to Use This Repository

### Running the Dash App
To explore SpaceX launch outcomes interactively:
1. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries (`Dash`, `pandas`, `plotly`).
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd DataScience-Project
   ```
3. Run the Dash app:
   ```bash
   python spacex_dash_app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8050`.

### Geospatial Insights with Folium
The `lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb` notebook uses Folium to visualize SpaceX launch sites and their proximities:
- **Launch Sites:** Explore coordinates and success rates.
- **Proximity Analysis:** View calculated distances to nearby infrastructure (e.g., highways, railways, coastlines).

### Additional Insights
- Machine learning predictions can be explored in the notebook `SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction_Part_5.ipynb`.
- SQL-based querying and analysis are available in `jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb`.

---

## Highlights and Findings
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Understand payload vs. success metrics using interactive sliders and filters.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Folium maps provide insights into optimal launch site locations.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Predictive accuracy for launch success enables informed decision-making.
